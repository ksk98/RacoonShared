# RaccoonTheThird
**This project is work in progress, everything is subject to change!**

Raccoon The Third is a scalable Discord bot platform that I'm developing for personal use.

This project consists of 3 repositories:
- [Server](https://github.com/ksk98/RaccoonTheThird "Raccoon server") used to host the dockerized bot
- [Client](https://github.com/ksk98/RacoonClient "Raccoon client") that provides functionalities such as browsing server logs, discord messages and speaking as bot
- [Shared library](https://github.com/ksk98/RacoonShared "Raccoon shared") that is used both by the server and client
